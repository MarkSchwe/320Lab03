# 320Lab03

*Same message as in the lab report.*

This lab assignment deals with counting the number of nodes in a binary tree with only one child node along with trying to find the maximum value within a binary tree, which I accomplished using recursion. I finished the code for this project in between 30-40 minutes and I did not receive help for any part of it. All the code is my original work entirely, although the buildIntTree function I used uses buildTree as a template, but instead of inserting characters as the data points within the tree, it uses random integers, in this case between 0 and 49. The program works very well. 

process of compiling each section:

Part I:

g++ -c 320Lab03.cpp
g++ 320Lab03.o -o 320Lab03
./320Lab03

Part II:

g++ -c 320Lab03-2.cpp
g++ 320Lab03-2.o -o 320Lab03-2
./320Lab03-2
